# Animated-Navigation

## Menu Bars

When you click on the menu bars icon (div with class menu-bars), it triggers a series of animations.
The bars transform into a close icon, and at the same time, an overlay with navigation links smoothly slides in from the left.

## Navigation Links:

Each navigation link (li elements with IDs nav-1 to nav-5) has its own sliding animation when the menu is opened or closed.
When opening the menu, the links slide in from left to right, and when closing, they slide out from right to left.

## Overlay:

The overlay (div with class overlay) serves as a background that covers the entire page.
It becomes visible when the menu is opened, and its appearance is animated to slide in from the left, creating a smooth transition effect.

## Toggle Effect:
#
The JavaScript code adds a class (change) to the menu bars when clicked, changing their appearance (rotating and fading) to provide a visual indication of the menu state.

## Section Transitions:

The different sections of the webpage (home, about, skills, projects, contact) have background color changes, creating a smooth visual transition when scrolling through the page.

Animated Navigation makes the menu and other elements on the page move in a visually appealing way. It adds a layer of interactivity and style to the user interface, making the website more engaging and user-friendly.
